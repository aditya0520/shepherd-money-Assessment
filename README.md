# Shepherd Money Interview Project

## Project Summary
Write a Spring Boot program that manages user creation/deletion and adding credit cards to their profiles. Users may have zero or more credit cards associated with them. Also, create two APIs: one to get all credit cards for a user and another to find a user by their credit card number. There is an additional API that update the balance history of a credit card.

I have thoroughly performed all the tasks and even tested the code by passing sample inputs and checking the database on http://localhost:8080/h2-ui

I used chatGPT for my assistance as I was not very well versed with Spring Boot's DB working.
